# Presentation Mode

Inspired by [this](https://staltz.com/your-ide-as-a-presentation-tool.html) post by AndrÃ© Staltz, here is a vscode extension that allows you to treat your editor more like a presentation tool.

## Usage

This extension looks for files that start with numbers to that it can determine an order to your presentation. For example, here is a presentation with 3 slides:

```
presentation
â”œâ”€â”€ 1.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 2.png
â””â”€â”€ 3.js
```

1.  To start a presentation type `present` into the command palette (`âŒ˜+SHIFT+P`). **This will take a little while to load as it searches your open project for files matching the above pattern and orders the slides** ðŸ˜¢
2.  Once everything is loaded you can navigate the next and previous slides with `CTRL+SHIFT+âŒ˜` and the arrow key for the direction you which to go.

**Note:** If you go past the end of the slides the presentation mode is automatically ended. You can manually canel the presentation by running the `End Presentation` command or clicking cancel on the progress notification.
